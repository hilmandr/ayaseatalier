title: "Restaurant Niko"
date: "2023-12-26"
summary: "Niko is a small Japanese restaurant, between tradition and the future. It was up to architecture to give materiality to this contradiction. On the one hand, it refers to street commerce, the lights, the signs, and the colors in contrast with the city's concrete. On the other hand, offering dynamics through technological possibilities, projecting what this business would be like in the encounter of different times."

This project's journey started as four-panel stories, which shaped the thinking of the design. In a documentary on BV Doshi, where he is at Sarkhej Roza in Ahmedabad, as Doshi walks through the spaces, he describes the beauty of the space through its quality of light, shadow, sense of transparency, and gradation of spaces. He also describes an inherent beauty in imperfection, a result of a hand-crafted building and its simplicity being a celebration of frugality. An edifice completely built and finished in a singular material.

The second story that influenced the design is about one of the visits to the clientâ€™s existing facility, a small production unit situated in a congested part of the city. Lots of plants, succulents, cacti, and exotic varieties filled all the site margins and gaps between the production sheds.

When we visited the new development, we passed by quite a few brick kilns. The local soil is clayey in nature, which is ideal for brickmaking. Clay brick, which was available locally as a material, lent a sense of warmth to the space, a connection to the soil that resonated with our thinking.

The initial thought was to create a series of gardens and courtyards spread across the ground, creating a path and an experience that would allow the user to move, pause, and enjoy this journey through space. The path within the garden was then defined by a series of coerced verandas, which straddle the notion of being considered partly indoors or partly outdoors.

The program was then formalized in the form of rooms alongside these verandahs to guide and steer the various views and experiences. With the aim to reduce the amount of concrete being used, the first thought came towards using brick for walls, floors, and roofs as well. Brick has an impression of being very heavy and solid. The traditional system of Jack arch (a tried and tested, mortar-less shallow arch system) with downstand beams and peripheral beams is used to make brick feel lighter, seeming to float over a space as brick has the impression of being heavy and solid.
